        <h3 id="a">About Us</h3>
        <p>We’re Emmanuel Electronics and we’ve been manufacturing power conditioning equipment here
        in Mumbai, India since 1996. We’re staunch proponents of working by the 3 R’s of business
        (Reliability, Responsiveness &amp; Respect) and we strive to achieve perfection through the
        technology we create.</p>
        <p>Our company is ISO9001-2015 certified, and we are involved in the design &amp;
        development of a variety of products ranging from servo stabilizers to high-end frequency
        converters &amp; UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply). I started this business owing to my
        strong desire to create something new using the skills I have. I love challenging jobs and,
        together with my team, I constantly endeavor to provide reliable and user-friendly solutions
        to our customers’ needs.</p>
        <p>With the recent rise in solar renewable energy initiatives in India, we plan to expand
        our activities in this area within the next few years. We are also keen about entering the
        up-and-coming fields of IoT &amp; Artificial Intelligence.</p>
        <p>Our company believes in growth through long-term business relations with its clients. We
        understand that the best investment we can make is in the faith of our customers, which is
        why we provide quick &amp; accessible service in most of the major cities in the
        country.</p>
        <p>Feel free to get in touch with us to learn more about what we do!</p>

        <section>
          <h4>Constant Voltage Transformers (CVTs)</h4>
          <img class="prod-img" src="media/img/cvt.jpg" alt="Constant Voltage Transformer Photo" />
          <p>Certain critical equipment (especially medical equipment) require Solid State Voltage
          (SSV) stabilizers with galvanic isolation between mains input and the equipment. Also, the
          equipment needs to be protected against spikes, voltage surges, glitches, noise, etc.,
          which is not possible with conventional Servo Voltage Controlled (SVC) stabilizers. A
          special type of stabilizer, called the Constant Voltage Transformer (CVT) is used for such
          applications.</p>

          <h4>Frequency Converters</h4>
          <img class="prod-img" src="media/img/frequency-converter.jpg" alt="Frequency Converter
          Photo" />
          <p>A frequency converter/changer is an electronic device that converts alternating current
          (AC) of one frequency to an alternating current of another frequency. The device may also
          change the voltage, if required.</p>

          <h4>Industrial Battery Chargers</h4>
          <img class="prod-img" src="media/img/industrial-battery-charger.jpg" alt="Industrial
          Battery Charger Photo" />
          <p>A battery charger is a device used to put energy into a secondary cell or rechargeable
          battery by forcing an electric current through it. The charging protocol depends on the
          size and type of the battery being charged.</p>

          <h4>On-Line UPS</h4>
          <img class="prod-img" src="media/img/on-line-ups.jpg" alt="On-Line UPS Photo" />
          <p>An on-line UPS is similar in operation to a standby UPS, but with the addition of a
          multi-tap variable-voltage autotransformer. This is a special type of transformer that can
          add or subtract powered coils of wire, thereby increasing or decreasing the magnetic field
          and the output voltage of the transformer.</p>

          <h4>Power Inverters</h4>
          <img class="prod-img" src="media/img/power-inverter.jpg" alt="Power Inverter Photo" />
          <p>A power inverter is an electronic device or circuitry that changes direct current (DC)
          to alternating current (AC). The input voltage, output voltage, frequency &amp; overall
          power handling all depend on the design of the specific device or circuitry.</p>

          <h4>Servo Stabilizers</h4>
          <img class="prod-img" src="media/img/servo-stabilizer.jpg" alt="Servo Stabilizer Photo" />
          <p>Servo Control Voltage Stabilizers are highly efficient voltage regulators that work
          equally well on any kind of load. It consists of a detector, a switching unit, a motorized
          auto-transformer &amp; a cut-off circuit. In case of any deviation from the set voltage,
          the detector sends an error signal to the control circuit that, in turn, drives a motor to
          correct the voltage using the winding on the auto-transformer.</p>
