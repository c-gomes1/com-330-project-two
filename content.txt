Industrial Battery Chargers

A battery charger is a device used to put energy into a secondary cell or rechargeable battery by
forcing an electric current through it. The charging protocol depends on the size and type of the
battery being charged.

Constant Voltage Transformers (CVTs)

Certain critical equipment (especially medical equipment) require Solid State Voltage (SSV)
stabilizers with galvanic isolation between mains input and the equipment. Also, the equipment needs
to be protected against spikes, voltage surges, glitches, noise, etc., which is not possible with
conventional Servo Voltage Controlled (SVC) stabilizers. A special type of stabilizer, called the
Constant Voltage Transformer (CVT) is used for such applications.

Power Inverters

A power inverter is an electronic device or circuitry that changes direct current (DC)
to alternating current (AC). The input voltage, output voltage, frequency & overall power
handling all depend on the design of the specific device or circuitry.

Frequency Converters

A frequency converter/changer is an electronic device that converts alternating
current (AC) of one frequency to an alternating current of another frequency. The device may also
change the voltage, if required.

Line-Interactive UPS

The line-interactive UPS is similar in operation to a standby UPS, but with the addition of a
multi-tap variable-voltage autotransformer. This is a special type of transformer that can add or
subtract powered coils of wire, thereby increasing or decreasing the magnetic field and the output
voltage of the transformer.
