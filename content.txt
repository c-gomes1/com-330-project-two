About Us

We’re Emmanuel Electronics and we’ve been manufacturing power conditioning equipment here in Mumbai,
India since 1996. We’re staunch proponents of working by the 3 R’s of business (Reliability,
Responsiveness & Respect) and we strive to achieve perfection through the technology we create.

Our company is ISO9001-2015 certified, and we are involved in the design & development of a variety
of products ranging from servo stabilizers to high-end frequency converters and UPS (Uninterruptible
Power Supply). I started this business owing to my strong desire to create something new using the
skills I have. I love challenging jobs and, together with my team, I constantly endeavor to provide
reliable and user-friendly solutions to our customers’ needs.

With the recent rise in solar renewable energy initiatives in India, we plan to expand our
activities in this area within the next few years. We are also keen about entering the up-and-coming
fields of IoT and Artificial Intelligence.

Our company believes in growth through long-term business relations with its clients. We understand
that the best investment we can make is in the faith of our customers, which is why we provide quick
& accessible service in most of the major cities in the country.
